# Attachmi - Project Overview

## What is Attachmi?

Attachmi is a desktop application for organizing and managing file attachments with rich metadata. It provides a centralized location to store documents and files while adding contextual information like descriptions, notes, and dates to make them easier to find and reference later.

## Problem Statement

Managing important documents and files often becomes chaotic over time. Files get scattered across different folders, and without proper context, it becomes difficult to remember what a file is about or why it was saved. Email attachments, downloaded receipts, reference documents, and other important files can easily get lost in a sea of unorganized data.

Attachmi solves this problem by providing a dedicated space to store files along with meaningful metadata. Instead of relying on file names and folder structures alone, users can add descriptions and notes to each attachment, making it easy to search and retrieve files based on their actual content and purpose.

## Application Type

Attachmi is a **cross-platform desktop application** that runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It operates as a native desktop app with local data storage, meaning all files and metadata stay on the user's machine without requiring cloud services or internet connectivity.

## Key Features

### File Management
- **Import files** by dragging and dropping them directly into the application or using the add attachment dialog
- **Open files** with the system's default application for quick viewing
- **Download/export files** back to any location on the computer
- **Delete attachments** when no longer needed, removing both the file and its metadata

### Rich Metadata
- **Custom naming** - Give attachments meaningful names separate from the original filename
- **Descriptions** - Add short descriptions to summarize what an attachment contains
- **Notes** - Attach longer notes with additional context, references, or reminders
- **Date tracking** - Record when attachments were added for chronological organization

### Collections
- **Group related attachments** into collections for better organization
- **Flexible categorization** - Attachments can belong to multiple collections
- **Quick filtering** - View all attachments within a specific collection

### Search and Navigation
- **Full-text search** across attachment names, descriptions, and notes
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for efficient navigation and common actions
- **Quick selection** - Navigate between attachments using keyboard commands

### Keyboard-Driven Workflow
- `Cmd/Ctrl+F` - Focus search
- `Cmd/Ctrl+N` - Add new attachment
- `Cmd/Ctrl+J/K` - Navigate between attachments
- `Cmd/Ctrl+O` - Open selected file
