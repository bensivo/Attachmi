# Manual Tests

We con't have a fully-automated test harness for this applicaiton yet, but we still need to be able to verify it functions as expected - especially considering I'm using Claude for a lot of it.

This folder is documentation for manual test cases. Each test case will follow this format:

```
### TC - <name>
Steps: 
- <step 1>
- <step 2>
```
